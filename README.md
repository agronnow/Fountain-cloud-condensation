This code includes the initial conditions and modifications to the PLUTO 4.1 magnetohydrodynamics code as used in the publication Gr√∏nnow, Tepper-Garcia & Bland-Hawthorn (2018) "Magnetic Fields in the Galactic Halo Restrict Fountain-driven Recycling and Accretion".
It includes metallicity dependent radiative cooling using the tables of Sutherland & Dopita (1993).
The halo magnetic field can be given as a function of distance by providing a table but this was not used in the paper where the magnetic field was uniform.
See the PLUTO documentation at http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/documentation.html on how to compile and run this code.

If you use parts of this code in published work please cite the paper mentioned above.
